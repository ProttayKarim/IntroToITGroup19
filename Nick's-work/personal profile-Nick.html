    <li>Email: s3344701@student.rmit.edu.au</li>
    <li>Greek/Australian</li>

    <li>I enjoy playing video games, watching AFL and professional wrestling, watching/reading anime/manga. 
        I have 1 dog named Harley; he is a Maltese shih-tzu cross.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ever since I was a little kid, I have been interested in video games and computers. I enjoy seeing how things work and how they interact with each other. 
    I currently have a little experience coding or anything software based, but I have built my own computer multiple times.
</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not too sure what my ideal job is currently, I was hoping to get a better understanding or find what I enjoy doing by doing this course. 
    I have found an interest in Artificial Intelligence and wish to explore where that will take me.

<p>Result of MBTI test</p>
<img src="http://puu.sh/FCaot/eb826cdc5a.png" alt="result of MBTI test is ISFP" height="300" width="400">
<p>My top 3 personalities for the Myers-Briggs test were: ISFP, ISTP and INFP in that order. 
    As an ISFP, my strengths are passionate, curious, sensitivity and charming, while my weaknesses are easily stressed, unpredictable and overly competetive.

<p>The results of the learning style quiz showed that I am a visual learner.</p>
<p>Result of big 5 personality test</p>
<img src="http://puu.sh/FC9Js/f2e8986e25.jpg" alt="result of big 5 personality test O=54%, C=42%, E=29%, A=67% and N=56%" height="200" width="300"> 
<p>The final test that I did was the "Big 5 peronality test". The results of this show that I am fairly open to new things. My conscientiousness is at 42% which shows that I am more spontaneous.
    My extroversion is at 29% which means I am more of an introvert. My agreeableness is at 67% which means I have a general concern for social harmony. Finally my neurotocism is at 56% which means I can experience a bit of negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety and depression.
